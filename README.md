# endo-loc

This project seeks to enable the rough inside/outside-patient localization of an endoscope. At this stage the proposed feature vector is meant to be a HSV histogram of the incoming endoscope image stream.

This software is developed along the principles of test-driven development. This implies that the current abilities of the software can be deduced from the "test_..." methods in all "tests_... .py" files in the tests package.
